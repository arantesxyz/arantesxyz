I started my programmer life with Java (mainly because of Minecraft) and soon got into JavaScript/TypeScript.

NodeJs has been my partner for the last 3 years in the field of Web Development and Script development and I've done more than 30 projects as a freelancer with it. It has been a long way and now, looking for a faster and compiled language I found Go (golang).
